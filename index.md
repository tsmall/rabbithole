# Come join us!

Let us nourish your child&rsquo;s natural sense of play and wonder!

The Rabbit Hole Studios offers classes for ages 4&ndash;6 and
7&ndash;10 that combines the centering power of yoga with the creative
release of improv, music, and storytelling.

Our teaching partners allow children to explore their senses and
creative instincts while providing an environment that promotes peace
and balance.

Come imagine, explore, and play!

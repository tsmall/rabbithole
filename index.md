We host workshops that explore our relationships &hellip;
to the world around us,
to each other and to ourselves.

Exploring ideas of body image,
nutrition,
social media addiction,
romance,
the pressure to succeed
&hellip;
Sometimes it takes a room full of women
to hash it all out. 

In our workshops we:

* practice meditation
* talk girltalk
* get really silly
* find confidence through freedom of expression  
* promote an attitude of gratitude

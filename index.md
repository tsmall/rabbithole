The Rabbit Hole is a place of peace and play. Engage your whole self through
yoga, movement, guided meditations, brain games, spirit games and silliness.

Here, you can find sanctuary. Here, you can express yourself. Here, existing
is everything.

<h1 class="extra-space">Our Mission</h1>

Sensory overload and the pressure to succeed go hand in hand in the Big
City. We know, because we face it too! The Rabbit Hole&rsquo;s mission is to
grow peaceful community spaces within the turbulent and high-octane matrix
of NYC.

In the spirit of those we&rsquo;ve learned from, [Eckhart Tolle][] and [Don
Miguel Ruiz][], our class allows you to &ldquo;be here now.&rdquo; Instead
of seeking a means to an end, we&rsquo;ll discover the infinite potential in
every moment.

We trust in ourselves and our community. We exchange ideas and love. We
achieve balance by being both flexible and strong.

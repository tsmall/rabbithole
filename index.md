# Come join us!

Your child&rsquo;s natural sense of play and wonder should be
nourished while they are their most open minded and carefree.

The Rabbit Hole Studio offers classes for ages 4&ndash;10 that
combines the centering power of yoga with the creative release of
improv and storytelling.

Our teaching partners allow children to explore their senses and
creative instincts while providing an environment that promotes peace
and balance.

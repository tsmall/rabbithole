# Come join us!

Your child&rsquo;s natural sense of play and wonder should be
nourished while they are their most open minded and carefree.

The Rabbit Hole Studio offers classes for ages 4&ndash;6 and
7&ndash;10 that combines the centering power of yoga with the creative
release of improv and storytelling.

Our teaching partners create an atmosphere where children are
encouraged to explore their senses and creative instincts while
providing an environment that promotes peace and balance.

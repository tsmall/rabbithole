Sensory overload and the pressure to succeed go hand in hand in the Big
City. We know, because we face it too! In the spirit of those we&rsquo;ve
learned from, [Eckhart Tolle][] and [Don Miguel Ruiz][], our classes allow
you to &ldquo;be here now.&rdquo; Instead of seeking a means to an end,
we&rsquo;ll discover the infinite potential in every moment.

The Rabbit Hole is a place of peace and play. Engage your whole self through
yoga, movement, guided meditations, brain games, spirit games and silliness.
We trust in ourselves and our community. We exchange ideas and love. We
achieve balance by being both strong and flexible.

Here, you can find sanctuary. Here, existing is everything. Here, a peaceful
mind and a peaceful heart make a peaceful world.

# Our Mission

Sensory overload and academic pressure go hand in hand with growing up
in the big city. The Rabbit Hole&rsquo;s mission is to provide a place
of peace and release for your child, to provide them the tools for a
balanced and creative life.

# About Us

The Rabbit Hole Studio offers classes for ages 4&ndash;10 that
combines the release of creative play and imagination with the peace
of balance and centering through yoga.

Our teaching partners understand the academic pressures and sensory
overload a child faces living in NYC. Because we face it too! In the
spirit of those we&rsquo;ve learned from, [Eckhart Tolle][] and [Don
Miguel Ruiz][], our class is structured to help your child &ldquo;be
here now&rdquo; and find stillness and release within our turbulent
and high-octane NYC.

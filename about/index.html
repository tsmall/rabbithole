            I started performing at age eight&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;because I love storytelling,
            but also because I&rsquo;m shy. Onstage, I can be anyone: a proud
            lioness, a southern debutante, a destitute villager, a lovestruck
            warrior. Offstage, I&rsquo;m still shy ol&rsquo; Marja who savors quiet
            moments, like watching milk marble into iced coffee. My life is a
            balance of practice and play. I practice gratitude. I practice
            kindness towards myself and others (the former is usually the more
            difficult task). I play with my friends, quoting random comedies
            and discussing life/love. And I&rsquo;m incredibly #lucky to be able to
            play for a living (currently on Broadway in Book of Mormon). I&rsquo;ve
            learned that soft or small does not equal insignificant. I find
            inspiration everywhere and always, but especially in:
            Christmas lights / folklore / long walks / Autumn / yoga / travel /
            Friends / Gabriel Garcia Marquez / Music / Paris (The Golden age,
            Audrey Tautou) / TED Talks / Rilke / laughter / breezes / New York
            City.

            Grey is my favorite color. Gloomy days, mountains, moral
            complexities&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;I just love everything grey. When
            I&rsquo;m not taking deep breaths or discussing the beautiful
            immensities of life, I take long exploratory walks around New York
            City. And I laugh a lot, mostly at banana humor, puns and
            impressions of anything (I do an awesome &lsquo;teapot&rsquo;). I
            published my first poem when I was eight years old (about the color
            green, my other fav shade), and I&rsquo;ve been writing poetry,
            songs and stories ever since. Right now, I&rsquo;m writing a
            musical about pigeons, totally my new fav animal (they&rsquo;re
            intelligent, loyal, and so beautiful -- check out the colors on
            those feathers). I possess the rare talent of &ldquo;rubber
            face,&rdquo; and enjoy honing my funny/ugly/scary face technique,
            to my parents&rsquo; eternal dismay. My favorite material
            possession is a huge disco ball that hangs in my living room and
            acts as the epicenter for epic pajama dance parties.

            I used to live in St. Louis, Washington D.C., Seattle, L.A., and
            London. Now I live in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. I used to be reaaal
            competitive and wanted to win all the time. Now I love seeing other
            people succeed even more. I used to feel guilty unless I was always
            busy. Now my favorite hobby is just existing. I used to be internet
            famous for my Harry Potter fan videos. Now if you Google me a bunch
            of Lexa bindings by Burton Snowboards show up. I used to be afraid
            other people wouldn&rsquo;t like me if I let them see me at Full
            Weird. Now I love that my spirit animal is a tree and I&rsquo;ll
            tell you all about it if I see you down the rabbit hole.
